		<h1>Scugog River Project</h1>
        <ul class="projects1"><li> We have completed successfully a major and complex survey around Scugog river
		for which drones were used for taking aerial images
		and them final draft was prepared using AutoCAD Map 3d.</li>
		<li>We even did a terrain survey and made contour map for that area using Total Stations and GIS techniques.</li>
		<li>Raw data like Digital Elevation Model and LandUse were downloaded from USGS portal.</li> </ul>

		<h1>Houston City Map</h1>
        <ul class="projects1"><li>Map of Houston city of Texas state, U.S.A made by one of the team member is published in the Journal of "Meteoritics and Planetary Science". </li>
		<li>This map was made using ArcGIS Pro and Avenza MapPublisher along with Adobe Illustrator.</li>
		<li>It shows the Land Use types, Streets hierarchy and Water bodies beautifully.</li> </ul>

            <ul class="projects1"><li>We have done many geometric corrections for the satellites data that we provide to our clients. </li>
            <li>An example of this is shown below where this image has been corrected using Catalyst Professional PCI Geomatica software using Ground Control Points.</li>
            <li>We provide corrected data to our clients on their demand.</li> </ul>

            <ul class="projects1"><li>We have made many models in ArcGIS Pro for the analysis of the spatial data.</li>
            <li>An example of such model building is here where we had to show the each post office's nearest households for Austin in U.S.A.</li>
            <li>Spatial Join tool was used to achieve this success.</li> </ul>
